                <p class="text-big">Coding is a list of step-by-step instructions that get computers to do what you want them to do.
                     Coding makes it possible for us to create computer software, games, apps and websites.
                      Coders, or programmers, are people who write the programmes behind everything we see and do on a computer.
                    We shall extensively learn coding in this event.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-big">Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.
            It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
             Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-big">From Cortana to autonomous vehicles, the rapid progress of AI development is showing no signs of slowing down. Artificial intelligence can encompass nearly anything,
             from search engine algorithms to robotics. Here's a more detailed definition of AI: Artificial intelligence (AI) is an interdisciplinary branch of computer science that builds smart machines. 
             These machines are capable of performing complex tasks, even ones that require human intelligence. AI uses a variety of approaches, such as deep learning and machine learning, to make jobs more natural to do.
              The vast improvement of these two capabilities has caused a paradigm shift in all sectors of the technology industry. There are two types of artificial intelligence: narrow AI (weak AI), and general AI (AGI or strong AI).</p>
